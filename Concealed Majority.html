All objects made of atoms pull on each other according to how much matter they contain. This is the effect of gravity and is why a small, low mass object such as an apple falls towards a much more massive object - the Earth.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astronomers believe that there must also be another kind of invisible "dark matter" which is spread throughout the Universe. By studying the Milky Way and many distant galaxies, they have found that visible matter alone cannot account for how fast stars rotate in them. On its own, normal matter would not be able to create enough gravity to hold these galaxies together.

Scientists can also tell that there is some unknown material in the space between the stars, because its gravitational pull influences the path of starlight travelling towards Earth. Matter – both ordinary and dark - can act like a magnifying glass, bending and distorting light from galaxies and clusters behind it.

    <td class="ContentText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspOnly about 15% of the matter in the Universe is made of atoms. The remainder is dark matter. However, no one knows what dark matter is made of. We do know that it does not absorb, emit or reflect light, because none of our scientific instruments can directly detect it.

Many scientists believe that most dark matter is some unknown subatomic (smaller than an atom) particle that interacts only very weakly with normal matter.</td>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is true, billions of these particles will have passed through your body by the time you finish reading this article. Experiments buried deep underground may one day measure the presence of one such particle passing through, finally solving the mystery of what dark matter really is.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black holes are the strangest objects in the Universe. A black hole does not have a surface, like a planet or star. Instead, it is a region of space where matter has collapsed in on itself. This catastrophic collapse results in a huge amount of mass being concentrated in an incredibly small area. The gravitational pull of this region is so great that nothing can escape – not even light.

    <td class="ContentText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although black holes cannot be seen, we know they exist from the way they affect nearby dust, stars and galaxies. Many of them are surrounded by discs of material. As the discs swirl around them like a whirlpool, they become extremely hot and give off X-rays.
Black holes come in many different sizes. Many of them are only a few times more massive than the Sun.</td>
